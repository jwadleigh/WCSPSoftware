WCSPSoftware
============

Software for driving the mechanical aspects of WCSP testing.

Download repo:
>git clone https://github.com/jwadleigh/WCSPSoftware.git

Ideally, open WCSP/WCSP.pro in QtCreator (http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator).
This is more important if you plan on editing the UI.

Otherwise if you just want to compile and run:<br >
Compile first by running qmake on the .pro (project) file to generate the make file.
>qmake WCSP.pro<br >
>make


Then run it with:<br >
>./WCSP
