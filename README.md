WCSPSoftware
============

Software for driving the mechanical aspects of WCSP testing.

Ideally, open WCSP/WCSP.pro in QtCreator (http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator).
This is more important if you plan on editing the UI.

Otherwise if you just want to compile and run...
Compile first by running qmake on the .pro (project) file to generate the make file:
  qmake WCSP.pro<br >
  make


Then run it with:
  ./WCSP
